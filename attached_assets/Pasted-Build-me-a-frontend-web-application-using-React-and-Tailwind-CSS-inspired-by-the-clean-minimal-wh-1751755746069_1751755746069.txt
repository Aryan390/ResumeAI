Build me a frontend web application using React and Tailwind CSS, inspired by the clean, minimal, whitespace-heavy Apple website design language, with a modern typography and elegant color palette.

Requirements:
âœ… Use React Router for routing, with the following routes:

/signin â†’ Sign In page

/signup â†’ Sign Up page

/dashboard â†’ Main app page after login

âœ… Use React Context API to manage and persist the authentication state of the user.

âœ… Design and build:

A Sign In page with email/password fields and a submit button.

A Sign Up page with email/password/confirm-password fields and a submit button.

A Dashboard page where:

A text box allows the user to enter a prompt.

Upon submitting the prompt, display an AI-generated resume below the textbox (you can use mocked static data for the resume for now).

Design Guidelines:
ðŸŽ¨ Typography & Colors:

Use clean, legible, modern typography (e.g., Inter, San Francisco, Helvetica Neue, or similar).

Use an elegant, neutral color palette inspired by the Apple website: whites, light grays, subtle blacks, with accent colors used sparingly.

ðŸ–¼ Layout & Whitespace:

Design should feel spacious with generous padding and margins.

Align elements consistently and keep the UI minimal and uncluttered.

Use Tailwind utilities effectively to create a premium look & feel.

ðŸ’» Other Notes:

Make sure the pages are responsive and work well on desktop and mobile.

Use semantic HTML wherever possible.

Organize the code in a clean folder structure.

Tailwind CSS configured.

React Router set up.

Components/pages as per the requirements.
